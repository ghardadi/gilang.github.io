                Using German households as case study, we calculate their carbon and material footprint as follows.<br>
1. Comparing household expenditure dataset from System of National Account (SNA) and Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) in the same (purchaser's) price and (COICOP) classification.<br>
2. Estimating the underreporting of each income group in a Monte-Carlo simulation <br>
3. Analysis of the clustering result Construction of a cluster network that shows relationship between clusters by shifted pattern similarity (Shape-Based Distance) and functional similarity (two-group enrichment test)</span></p>

              <p class="p2"><span class="s2">Pathway Logic is a rewriting-logic-based formal system for modeling biological pathways including post-translational modifications. Integrating gene expression data on PL system, we constructed subtype-specific path from key receptors (TNFR, TGFBR1 and EGFR) to key transcription factor (TF) regulators (RELA, ATF2, SMAD3 and ELK1) and to downstream genes targeted by TF. Proposed method identified potential pathway crosstalk via TFs in basal-specific paths, which could provide a novel insight on aggressive breast cancer subtypes.</span></p>
